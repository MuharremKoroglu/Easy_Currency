## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
This app is a currency converter. It shows developers how to use the data provided over the internet in the application. Here we got the data via Fixer API. While opening the application, first of all, we received the six foreign currency units that we had chosen. Thanks to API, we pulled the value of these units against Euros from the internet. For this, we first created the API URL with the help of a variable. Then we created a URLSession. After that, we created a task. We wrote the code block we needed with the help of a closure in this task we created. First of all, we showed the user any error that may occur in data exchange with the UIAlertController. In this way, the user can understand the error that occurred. If no error occurs, the code block continues from the second stage. Here we used a JSONSerialization. In this way, we got feedback from the API. We have drawn the blocks we want to use in the feedback received into our application within the business structure. This way, the user can see the value of six currencies against the euro when the application is first opened. Then the user can convert the number of euros in his hand to the foreign currency units he sees. For this, we used the convert method offered by Fixer API. Thanks to this method, we can convert any amount we want from one currency to another. We created all of the currencies as a button. We have created a function called currency conversion to avoid code clutter. This function receives the currency unit information to be converted from the buttons. Then it takes the amount of foreign currency entered by the user via TextField. These received data are processed by the internet via the API and displayed via the Money Label in our application. Finally, we set the keyboard only as "decimalPad" so that the user does not enter any String values into the TextField. We also added a GestureRecognizer to the screen. In this way, the user can quickly close the keyboard when he clicks on any empty part of the screen.
